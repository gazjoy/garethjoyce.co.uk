    <ol>
        <li>Design for everyone: I aim to make everything I do understandable and usable for all</li>
        <li>Do just enough: I like to keep things simple and do not believe in putting work out into the world without it having a purpose</li>
        <li>Meet the need: I'm user centrered and use research and data to design based on real needs</li>
    </ol>
