<p>I have always cared about creating inclusive experiences but since working for Valtech I have been lucky enough
    to see first hand the barriers disabled people face daily in accessing digital products.</p>

<p>I have designed products only to see them unusable by blind people, my learning from these experiences is
        what drives me to consider the design process in an access first approach. If you can make a digital
        product work for a blind person, you can make it work for everyone.</p>

  <p>I am one of Valtech's Accessibility Craft Circle leads. I'm helping Valtech understand accessibility, what it means in 
    business terms as well as how accessibility considerations need to be at the heart of all digital design work we create
    for clients.</p>

    <p>I design products for inclusivity and follow <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/">Microsoft's Inclusive Design methodology</a>.
