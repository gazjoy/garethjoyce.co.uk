<p class="lead">Working with the Department for Transport to improve the experience for Blue Badge applicants and process optimisation for local authorities.</p>

<p>To award a Blue Badge, local authorities need to validate that someone applying for a Blue Badge with a DWP benefit is entitled to that benefit.</p>
<p>Our team at Valtech worked with over 50 local authorities from England, Wales and Scotland to understand the disparate ways they were working to validate the benefit entitlement.</p>
<p>We found many were still reliant on the applicant providing a photo or scan of their benefit award letter.</p>
<p>This meant applicants were spending a lot of time digitising physical letters. We also found that some local autohiries had direct access to DWP systems.</p>
<p>This enabled them to validate the benefit entitlement directly.</p>
<p>We were able to collate evidence,</p>

<p>Used task timings, saving applicants over 4 minutes on average.</p>
<p>One of the largest areas of negative user feedback on the digital service is the need for applicants to provide evidence of a qualifying benefit.</p>
<p>We looked at challenging the need for this evidence.</p>
